cleanmywallet

## Overview

CleanMyWallet is a powerful tool designed to help users manage, optimize, and clean up their Solana wallets. Over time, wallets can accumulate unused or empty Associated Token Accounts (ATAs), which can lock up small amounts of SOL as rent. CleanMyWallet provides an easy way to identify and close these zero-balance ATAs, allowing users to reclaim their locked SOL and keep their wallets organized.

## Features

- Identify zero-balance ATAs that are eligible for closure
- Close empty ATAs in a single click to redeem SOL rent
- User-friendly interface for safe and efficient wallet management

## Why Close Zero-Balance ATAs?

On the Solana blockchain, every token account (ATA) requires a small amount of SOL to be held as rent. When a token account has a zero balance, it still occupies space and keeps your SOL locked. By closing these empty ATAs, you can reclaim the rent and increase your available SOL. CleanMyWallet automates this process, making it simple and secure.
